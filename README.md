Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful yet costly technique for studying cellular
diversity within the complexity of the brain. Here, we sought to establish an effective multiplexing
strategy for the adult mouse brain that could allow multiple experimental groups to be pooled into
a single sample for sequencing, thus substantially reducing costs and batch effect. We first describe
an optimized cold temperature single-cell dissociation protocol that permits isolation of a high
yield and viability of brain cells from the adult mouse. Cells isolated using this protocol were then
screened by flow cytometry using a panel of antibodies, allowing identification of a single
antibody, anti-Thy1.2, that is capable of tagging the vast majority of isolated mouse brain cells.
We then used this primary antibody against a “universal” neural target, together with secondary
antibodies carrying sample-specific oligonucleotides and the BD Rhapsody single cell system, and
show that multiple adult mouse brain samples can be pooled into a single multiplexed run for
scRNAseq. Bioinformatic analyses enable efficient demultiplexing of the sequenced pooled brain
sample, with high tagging efficiency and precise annotation and clustering of brain cell
populations. The efficiency and flexibility of the cell dissociation protocol and the two-step
multiplexing strategy simplifies experimental design, eliminates sequencing batch effects and
reduces sequencing costs
